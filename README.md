# lazy-dev-vue

Typescript oriented vue live templates.

# Versions
## v0.0.2a - doc mods (and brought back old templates for later following migration)

marked as "deprecated" (to be migrated to lazy "qwe" and for inline code _qwe):
### Migrated
- `tvcwp` - test vue component with a property, use `qwe-test-vue-base-component` Migrated

### To Be Migrated
- `tvcwsmag` - test vue component with store, mutation, action and getter
- `tvc-with-prop-and-listener` - test vue component with property and listener
- `_tv_text_match` - 
- `_tv_trigger_event` - 

### To be removed
- ~~tvc-with-prop~~ - (duplicate) see tvcwp
  
### newly Added (v0.0.2a)
Trying lazy approach - with `qwe` live template prefix (hope no big breaks will follow). 
- `qwe-test-vue-base-component` - test vue base component with a property
- `qwe-vue-base-component` - generate vue base component with a property
